Accepted values for this function are"min","max","mean"(default),"median","sum","coverage.weighted". The last method is applicable only for sequencing-based methylation datasets. It computes the weighted average of the values of the associated CpGs, whereby weights are calculated based on the coverages of the respective sites.	"mean"
region.subsegments	If a number larger than 1 is specified,RnBeadswill subdivide each region specified in theregion.typesoption into subsegments containing on averageregion.subsegmentssites per subsegment.

These are represented by a namedintegervector, in which the names are:"chr","start","end","strand","meth","coverage","c"and"t". These names correspond the columns for chromosome, start position, end position, strand, methylation degree, read coverage, number of reads with C and number of reads with T, respectively. Methylation degree and/or read coverage, if not specified, are inferred from the values in the columns"c"and"t". Further details and examples of BED files can be found in Section 4.1 of the RnBeads vignette.	NA
import.bed.frame.shift	Singleton of typeintegerspecifying the frame shift between the coordinates in the input BED file and the corresponding genomic reference. This (integer) value is added to the coordinates from the BED file before matching the methylation sites to the annotated ones.	1

normalization	Flag controlling whether the data should be normalized and normalization report generated. Setting this toNULL(default) enables this step for analysis on Infinium datasets, but disables it in case of sequencing-based datasets. Note that normalization is never applied in sequencing datasets; if this flag is enabled, it will lead to a warning message.	NULL

filtering.whitelist	Name of a file specifying site or probe identifiers to be whitelisted. Every line in this file must contain exactly one identifier. The whitelisted sites are always retained in the analysed datasets, even if filtering criteria or blacklisting requires their removal. For Infinium studies, the file must contain Infinium probe identifiers. For bisulfite sequencing studies, the file must contain CpG positions in the form "chromosome:coordinate" (1-based coordinate of the cytosine), e.g.chr2:48607772. Unknown identifiers are silently ignored.	NULL
filtering.blacklist	Name of a file specifying site or probe identifiers to be blacklisted. Every line in this file must contain exactly one identifier. The blacklisted sites are removed from the analysed datasets as a first step in the preprocessing module. For Infinium studies, the file must contain Infinium probe identifiers. For bisulfite sequencing studies, the file must contain CpG positions in the form "chromosome:coordinate" (1-based coordinate of the cytosine), e.g.chr2:48607772. Unknown identifiers are silently ignored.	NULL

filtering.sex.chromosomes.removal	Flag indicating if the removal of probes located on sex chromosomes should be performed as a filtering step.	FALSE
filtering.missing.value.quantile	Number between 0 and 1, indicating the fraction of allowed missing values per site. A site is filtered out when its methylation beta values areNAs in a larger fraction of samples than this threshold. Setting this option to 1 (default) retains all sites, and thus effectively disables the missing value filtering step in the preprocessing module. If this is set to 0, all sites that contain missing values are filtered out.	1
filtering.coverage.threshold	Threshold for minimal acceptable coverage. This must be a non-negative value. Setting this option to 0 (zero) effectively considers any known or unknown read coverage for sufficiently deep.	5
filtering.low.coverage.masking	Flag indicating whether methylation values for low coverage sites should be set to missing. In combination withfiltering.missing.value.quantilethis can lead to the removal of sites.	FALSE
filtering.high.coverage.outliers	(Bisulfite sequencing mode) Flag indicating whether methylation sites with a coverage of more than 10 times the 95-percentile of coverage should be removed.	FALSE
filtering.deviation.threshold	Threshold used to filter probes based on the variability of their assigned beta values. This must be a real value between 0 and 1, denoting minimum standard deviation of the beta values in one site across all samples. Any sites that have standard deviation lower than this threshold are filtered out. Note that sites with undetermined varibility, that is, sites for which there are no measurements (all beta values areNAs), are retained. Setting this option to 0 (default) disables filtering based on methylation variability.	0
imputation.method	Character indicating which imputation method should be used to replace missing values. This option has to be one of the following values"none","mean.cpgs","mean.samples","random"or"knn". Setting this option to"none"inactivates imputation (default).	"none"

These traits are used in multiple steps in the module: they are visualized using point types and colors in the dimension reduction plots; tested for strong correlations and associations with principal components in a methylation space; used to define groups when plotting beta distributions and/or inter-sample methylation variability. The default value of this parameter -NULL- indicates that columns should be automatically selected; seernb.sample.groupsfor how this is done.	NULL
exploratory.top.dimensions	Number of most variable probes, sites or regions to select prior to performing dimension reduction techniques and tests for associations. Preselection can significantly reduce the running time and memory usage in the exploratory analysis module. Setting this number to zero (default) disables preselection.	0

Deviation plots show intra-group methylation variability at the covered sites and regions. Setting this option toNULL(default) enables deviation plots on Infinium datasets, but disables them in case of sequencing-based datasets, because their generation can be very computationally intensive. This option has effect only whenexploratory.intersampleisTRUE.	NULL
exploratory.clustering	Which sites should be used by clustering algorithms in the exploraroty analysis module.RnBeadsperforms several algorithms that cluster the samples in the dataset. If this option is set to"all"(default), clustering is performed using all sites; a value of"top"indicates that only the most variable sites are used (see the optionexploratory.clustering.top.sites); and"none"disables clustering.	"all"

exploratory.clustering.heatmaps.pdf	Flag indicating if the generated methylation value heatmaps in the clustering section of the exploratory analysis module should be saved as PDF files. Enabling this option is not recommended for large values ofexploratory.clustering.top.sites(more than 200), because heatmaps might generate very large PDF files.	FALSE
exploratory.region.profiles	Region types for generating regional methylation profiles. IfNULL(default), regional methylation profiles are created only for the region types that are available for the targeted assembly and summarized in the dataset of interest. Setting this option to an empty vector disables the region profiles step in the exploratory analysis module.	NULL

differential.permutations	Number of permutation tests performed to compute the p-value of rank permutation tests in the differential methylation analysis. This must be a non-negativeinteger. Setting this option to0(default) disables permutation tests for rank permutations. Note that p-values for differential methylation are computed and also considered for the ranking in any case.	0
differential.comparison.columns	Column names or indices in the table of the sample annotation table to be used for group definition in the differential methylation analysis. The default value -NULL- indicates that columns should be automatically selected. Seernb.sample.groupsfor how this is done. By default, the comparisons are done in a one vs. all manner if there are multiple groups defined in a column.	NULL
differential.comparison.columns.all.pairwise	Column names or indices in the table of sample annotation table to be used for group definition in the differential methylation analysis in which all pairwise comparisons between groups should be conducted (the default is one vs all if multiple groups are specified in a column). Caution: for large numbers of sample groups this can lead to combinatorial explosion and thus to huge runtimes. A value ofNULL(default) indicates that no column is selected for all pairwise comparisons explicitely. If specified, the selected columns must be a subset of the columns that will be selected according to thedifferential.comparison.columnsoption.	NULL
covariate.adjustment.columns	Column names or indices in the table of phenotypic information to be used for confounder adjustment in the differential methylation analysis. Currently this is only supported fordifferential.site.test.method=="limma".	NULL

For more details seernb.sample.groups	NULL
differential.adjustment.sva	Flag indicating if the differential methylation analysis should account for Surrogate Variables. IfTRUE,RnBeadslooks for overlaps between thedifferential.comparison.columnsandinference.targets.svaoptions and include the surrogate variables as confounding factors only for these columns. In other words, it will only have an effect if the corresponding inference option (seeinference.targets.svaoption for details) is enabled. Currently this is only supported fordifferential.site.test.method=="limma".	TRUE
differential.adjustment.celltype	Should the differential methylation analysis account for celltype using the reference based Houseman method.
