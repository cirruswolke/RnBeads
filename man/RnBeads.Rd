\title{Analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation data with RnBeads}
\description{
RnBeads facilitates comprehensive analysis of various types of DNA methylation data at the genome scale. It extends
previous approaches for such analysis by high throughput capabilities, as well as presenting results in a
comprehensive, highly interpretable fashion.
}
\details{
The complete analysis can be performed by calling the function \code{\link{rnb.run.analysis}}.
